# What is Data Science?

## Definition:

*IBM*: "Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning."
